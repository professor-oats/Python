# Python
Collection of Python scripts

## MyTeamsMonster
Project as part vocational education to learn how to consume API:s with Python.
Got the idea to build some code that will proxy the API between Teams and Gemini AI
to make some fun shenanigans.

## NetworkPy
Scripts related to generic networking. Testing some websocketing and more.

## ITHS_Labb1
Oat's Nmapper - A kind of wrapper for nmap.
Run script with same privileges as you would run nmap

Tested on systems:
* FreeBSD

To improve in skills:
* Better up system analysis and design to present logic before translating
  to code.

To improve in coding tools:
* Start with some kind of tests to not have to retype every run
