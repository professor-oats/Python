# In current form the wget won't resolve the DNS to the site from attacker host properly
# possibly since it listens for DNS requests with the sniffing process on port 53.
Sol - Rearranged the logic so we start servers before trafficing on port 53,
udp shall be unbound but still things go sluggish when sniffing and doing own DNS queries. Perhaps some stack push or something

# We have to ensure that the stripping and redirects works well and that
# both http and https servers run properly and are terminated correctly
# by their threads. Also test so the self_signed perm works fluently for the https connection

Progress - Have managed to get a fully functioning https server now with the self cert
however there is showing a warning for the https site instead of redirecting to http connection
Also encounter JS inject error, so I think I will test through browser redirect.
Also, to possibly circumvent the unsafe site warning we could try to hack
some way so the victim ends up on the http connection without any ssl missing warning 
due to native http.
Could try a proper scapy sniff + SSL strip on the request if redirect won't work
